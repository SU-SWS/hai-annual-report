          According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health, Black/African Americans make up the largest group of minorities in need of an organ transplant. However, they comprised 12.5% of organ donors in 2019. The Dalio Center, in collaboration with the Black Liver Health Initiative, has launched an effort to study and address the issue through data and outcomes evaluations, study of patient experience, and the support of outreach webinars and website development. The Dalio Center collaborates with the Black Liver Health Initiative (BLHI), which was co- founded by Nicole Golden, DNP, FNP-BC, Veronica Roye, DNP, FNP-BC, and Monica Nelson-Kone, BSN, RN, and will be working to bring the BLHI process and interventions to other solid organ transplant programs across NYP.

The Dalio Center is now working with Felicia, the Weill Cornell nursing team, and our colleagues in strategic sourcing, patient experience, and social work to formalize and expand Felicia's work. By providing a broader array of hair care products suitable to different hair textures, along with staff training on hair care, NYP can better meet our patients’ needs and improve patient experience.

          The Dalio Center is collaborating with our medical school partners and Hospital operations to develop new institutional projects focused on improving the quality of and access to our care. The ultimate goal of these programs is not only to connect residents of our communities with high quality health care, but also to encourage them to become advocates for their own health and their family members’ health — so that good health behaviors become a longstanding part of their lives. Together, these initiatives have a broad reach and help meet the Hospital's commitment to improving health care outcomes and increasing access for the members of its communities in a manner that underscores collaboration and community involvement.

            It is because we share a compelling need for there to be more justice in healthcare that we all are excited by our partnership with NewYork-Presbyterian to create this new center for health justice. Barbara and I, and those at NewYork-Presbyterian, and many people in the communities who need help are perfectly aligned in supporting this mission.
